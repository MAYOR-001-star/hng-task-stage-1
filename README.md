🧑‍💻 HNG Internship – Frontend Wizards Stage 1 Task

This project is my submission for the HNG Frontend Track Stage 1 — a continuation of my Stage 0 task.

It expands the single profile card into a multi-page personal website with semantic HTML,

accessible forms, and responsive layouts — all built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no frameworks).
