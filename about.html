        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I am a Computer Science student with a strong focus on web development.
          I'm passionate about turning creative ideas into functional and
          accessible digital experiences using modern technologies like React,
          Next.js, and Tailwind CSS.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside coding, I enjoy football, gaming, and experimenting with design
          tools like Figma to improve my sense of layout and usability.
        </p>

      <section data-testid="test-about-goals">
        <h3>Goals in This Program</h3>
        <p>
          My main goal is to sharpen my problem-solving skills, gain hands-on
          experience working on real-world projects, and grow into a
          well-rounded full-stack developer who can handle both frontend and
          backend development with confidence.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also want to collaborate with other developers, learn new workflows,
          and build a strong professional network in the tech ecosystem.
        </p>

      <section data-testid="test-about-confidence">
        <h3>Areas of Low Confidence</h3>
        <p>
          One area I'm still building confidence in is backend scalability —
          designing APIs and managing database structures efficiently for
          larger-scale projects. I'm also working on improving my understanding
          of advanced TypeScript patterns and testing best practices.

      <section data-testid="test-about-future-note">
        <h3>Note to My Future Self</h3>
        <p>
          Stay curious. Keep learning. Every bug you fix and every feature you
          ship is a step forward. Never lose the excitement you had when you
          first built something that actually worked. And remember — consistent
          progress beats perfection.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section data-testid="test-about-extra">
        <h3>Extra Thoughts</h3>
        <p>
          This journey is just the beginning. I plan to keep refining my craft,
          exploring open-source contributions, and mentoring upcoming
          developers once I've gained enough experience. The goal isn’t just to
          code — it's to create meaningful solutions.
